# jq language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and some basic indentation rules for the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) language to [Atom](https://atom.io/).

The creation of this package was greatly helped by the [simplified jq grammar](https://github.com/fadado/JBOL/blob/38c5b73f9494bee13575674bd19a7ff15ad24e66/doc/JQ-language-grammar.md) by @fadado. Thanks!
